\subsection{Land-use prioritization model (L. D. Estes et al. 2016)}\label{land-use-prioritization-model-estes2016a}}

Our analysis builds on the \texttt{agroEcoTradeoff} land-use model described in L. D. Estes et al. (2016) and applied to Zambia. The \texttt{agroEcoTradeoff} model is designed to prioritize areas for agricultural expansion in order to meet a set of crop-specific production targets while simultaneously minimizing four costs: the total area of land required (i.e.~maximizing yields), transportation costs, carbon released through conversion of natural vegetation to agriculture, and biodiversity loss. The model requires spatially explicit inputs representing these four costs in the form of maps with pixel values ranging from 0-1. The model is structured to express these costs in terms of production efficiency, or cost per unit yield estimated to result from the conversion of a given cell. These constraints are then weighted according to user preferences and combined into a single map of ``conversion priority.'' Cells are then sequentially chosen for conversion until a user-specified production target is met, based on the expected yield in each cell and adjusted to account for the proportion of each pixel that is not currently cropped, settled, protected, or with slopes greater than 20\%.

\hypertarget{non-bd-inputs}{%
\subsubsection{Non-biodiversity model inputs}\label{non-bd-inputs}}

In our analysis, we use this model to explore how a range of approaches for formulating biodiversity values affect land-use recommendations. We therefore use the same settings for non-biodiversity elements as applied in L. D. Estes et al. (2016), including representative future production targets for maize and soy (projecting a fourfold increase for maize and a 10-fold increase for soy by 2050, compared with 2009--2014 average), as well as the input yield, carbon density, and travel cost maps. Yield estimates are modeled using DSSAT (Jones et al. 2003) based on weather station data and soil profiles, mapped to a 1 km\(^2\) grid using a generalized additive model, and rescaled to match FAO yield-growth projections for Zambia by 2050 (see Figure \ref{fig:yield}). Travel cost is based on travel time to the nearest market town. Carbon loss is based on estimates of aboveground and belowground biomass carbon stocks Baccini et al. (2012). Additional detail on the model structure and how constraints were modeled can be found in L. D. Estes et al. (2016). The general structure of the model is illustrated in Fig. 1b. See L. D. Estes et al. (2016) for additional details.

Average yields, used in the pure biodiversity (\emph{bp}) and 50\% conversion (\emph{z50}) model weighting specifications, are 5.30 tons/ha for maize and 3.38 tons/ha for soy. See L. D. Estes et al. (2016) for details on how yields were modeled.}\label{fig:yield}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{model-weights}{%
\subsection{Model weighting specifications}\label{model-weights}}

As our analysis primarily focuses on the consequences of variation in biodiversity metrics, the main text presents the results of model runs that place 100\% of model weight on biodiversity and assume average yields throughout Zambia, model specifications designed to isolate only variation due to the biodiversity input (our primary analysis, which we label \emph{bp}, and scenario involving an increased production target, labeled \emph{z50}). Because the model can factor in heterogeneous yields in order to estimate the lowest-cost cells for meeting production targets (by calculating the production efficiency, or biodiversity cost/yield), those differential yields could play a significant role in the final selections. To remove the influence of yield in our base scenario (\emph{bp}) and the increased production target scenario (\emph{z50}), we assumed constant, average yields for maize and soy throughout Zambia (5.30 tons/ha for maize and 3.38 tons/ha for soy; see Figure \ref{fig:yield}).

Ignoring non-biodiversity constraints and removing yield variation means that pixels are selected for conversion based only on their biodiversity value, selecting the least valuable cell and sequentially converting pixels until the production target is met. In addition to our main analysis (\emph{bp}), we also assessed the effect of increasing our production target to assess the scale dependence of our results (\emph{z50}, see Section \ref{section-prod-targ}) and the effect of incorporating heterogeneous yield estimates (\emph{b}) and distributing weight from biodiversity onto the other three costs (Section \ref{weights-results}). We also directly compared the sequential order of conversion (and, inversely, protection) based on biodiversity value (Section \ref{section-order}).

We ran the model through five additional scenarios that progressively shared weight between biodiversity and yield, carbon loss, and transportation cost, allowing these factors to also influence conversion decisions. These are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{b} = 100\% biodiversity, accurate, spatially heterogeneous yields
\item
  \emph{by} = 50\%/50\% biodiversity/yield
\item
  \emph{bc} = 50\%/50\% biodiversity/carbon
\item
  \emph{bt} = 50\%/50\% biodiversity/transportation cost, and
\item
  \emph{byct} = 25\% weight on biodiversity, yield, carbon, and transportation cost
\end{itemize}

See full results for these additional weighting specifications in Section \ref{weights-results}.

Our baseline production target is based on current projections of future demand and yield increases, and converts to cropland an additional \textasciitilde5\% of Zambia's remaining unprotected, uncultivated, and undeveloped land area (approximately 22,000 km\(^2\)). In addition to these analyses, we also assessed the effect of increasing our production target so that \textasciitilde50\% of Zambia's available land area would be converted, in order to assess scale dependence. This model specification (\emph{z50}), also assumes constant, average yields throughout Zambia, just like the primary analysis (\emph{bp}). See Section \ref{section-prod-targ} for details and results.

\hypertarget{bd-inputs}{%
\subsection{Construction of biodiversity indices}\label{bd-inputs}}

In order to capture the variation in how biodiversity can be represented in prioritization analyses, we construct a range of biodiversity indices representing variation within five groups (``\textbf{categories of variation}''), each with multiple options, or factors. First, we compare a set of published biodiversity indices. We then develop multiple biodiversity indices that capture \emph{biological variation}, including different taxonomic groups and different species richness metrics, and \emph{methodological variation}, including index calculation methods and input spatial resolution. These biodiversity indices are either drawn from the literature (as noted) or derived from a set of expert vertebrate species range maps obtained from BirdLife International (bird species; BirdLife International and Handbook of the Birds of the World (2018)), the IUCN (mammal and amphibian species; IUCN (2017)), and GARD (reptile species; Roll et al. (2017)), and are constructed as follows.

  \emph{estes}: L. D. Estes et al. (2016)'s composite incorporates threat, rarity, and intactness of potential natural vegetation (PNV) types of eastern and southern Africa, described by Van Breugel et al. (2015). Rarity was calculated as the proportion of Zambia occupied by that vegetation type (these values were log transformed due to a highly skewed distribution). Threat was calculated as the proportion of vegetation falling within a protected area. Low values correspond to a rare, relatively unprotected vegetation class, one with high conservation priority. Intactness was then calculated based on the proportion of undisturbed vegetation existing in the surrounding 11 km \(\times\) 11 km neighborhood. As shown in Equation \eqref{eq:estes-comp}, the final composite was calculated as follows:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{equation}
Index = \frac{(rarity \cdot threat) + intactness}{2}

  \emph{damania}: Damania and Wheeler (2015)'s composite combines two sublayers, 1) vertebrate species richness weighted by endemism and threat status, and 2) ecoregion rarity based on area. They use a unique approach that combines factors by taking the maximum value at each cell across multiple layers. They first calculate species richness weighted by both endemism (range-size rarity) and by extinction risk (assessed by IUCN threat status), for all four verebrate taxonomic groups. They then take the maximum across these eight layers at each pixel to calculate their first sublayer. They then calculate ecoregion rarity based on the inverse of ecoregion area. These two sublayers are then converted to percentiles. The final composite consists of the maximum of these two sublayers. Note: following Damania and Wheeler (2015), this includes threatened reptile species from IUCN, despite the fact that reptiles have not been comprehensively assessed.
\item
  \emph{laurance}: the biodiversity-specific subset of Laurance et al. (2014)'s environmental values index, combining two equally weighted sublayers: 1) equally weighted a) threatened vertebrate species richness and b) total plant species richness, and 2) four equally weighted pre-existing habitat prioritization layers, a) biodiversity hotspots (Myers et al. (2000)), b) global 200 ecoregions (Olson and Dinerstein (2002)), c) IBAs/EBAs (Stattersfield et al. (1998); Waliczky et al. (2019)), and d) High Biodiversity Wilderness Areas (HBWA) combined with Frontier Forests (Mittermeier et al. (2003); Bryant, Nielsen, and Tangley (1997)). See Equation \eqref{eq:laurance-comp} below.
\end{enumerate}

Laurance et al. (2014) produced an ``environmental values layer'' from three equally weighted sub-layers: 1) biodiversity, 2) key habitats, and 3) carbon and climate regulation ecosystem services (estimates of net carbon emissions from land use change and estimates of atmospheric temperature and moisture regulation). In order to prioritize areas for protection and roads development, this environmental values layer was then combined with a ``road-benefits layer,'' based on four equally weighted continuous agricultural metrics (1. areas with closing yield gaps, 2. existing agriculture, 3. distance to markets, 4. projected production increases{]} multiplied by a fifth metric (5. agroecological suitability). Given that the focus of this paper is on biodiversity, and specifically variation in different approaches to representing biodiversity in a single index, we extract only those parts of Laurance et al. (2014)'s index that specifically relate to biodiversity: 1) threatened vertebrate and plant species richness, and 2) the four habitat priorities. Climate related ecosystem service layers were excluded, along with economic factors. Frontier Forests do not occur within Zambia, so were also excluded from our analysis. See more details in Laurance et al. (2014) and \url{https://www.global-roadmap.org/}.

  \emph{vert\_endemism}: Endemism richness, alternatively known as rarity-weighted richness, range area-weighted species richness, or rarity-weighted species endemism richness, following Kier et al. (2009), Williams et al. (1996), and Soto-Navarro et al. (2020). Endemism richness is the sum, for all species present in a cell, of the proportion of each species' range contained in that cell (i.e.~the summed inverse of range size). This effectively weights species richness by each species' global range size, giving species with smaller ranges greater weight, combining elements of both endemism and species richness. Endemism richness is calculated for each taxa first, normalizing each taxa individually before averaging across all taxa into a composite for all vertebrate species combined (Brancalion et al. 2019). This approach treats each taxonomic group equally, but in doing so gives individual species in more speciose groups relatively less weight. We assess the impact of the order in which these layers are normalized and combined in Section \ref{section-norm-order}.

\textbf{Richness for all vertebrate species combined:} values are calculated by first calculating richness within each taxonomic group, normalizing to between 0-1, then averaging across all four taxonomic groups, following Brancalion et al. (2019). See Section \ref{section-norm-order} for a detailed comparison of this approach with the opposite (summing across all taxonomic groups without normalizing first), as taken by Laurance et al. (2014).

Different methods for combining multiple layers, for three pairs of layers: 1) threatened mammal and bird species richness (\emph{mb}), approximating an approach focused on the two vertebrate taxa for which we have the best data, and which also have relatively large numbers of threatened species within Zambia; 2) vertebrate species richness and plant species richness (\emph{vp}), approximating the goal of treating all species as equally valuable; and 3) vertebrate species richness with endemism richness (\emph{ae}), approximating a goal of compromising between aspects of richness, endemism, and rarity, following in part Soto-Navarro et al. (2020).

\hypertarget{input-spatial-resolution}{%
\subsubsection{Input spatial resolution}\label{input-spatial-resolution}}

We calculated each input raster at three resolutions: 1 km grid (1 km\(^2\)), 10 km grid (100 km\(^2\)), and 110 km grid (12,100 km\(^2\), or roughly 1\(^{\circ}\) latitude at the equator). We downscaled raster cell values to the desired resolution using the mean value of the cells (via \texttt{raster::aggregate()}). Because the \texttt{agroEcoTradeoff} model requires inputs to have a 1 km grid resolution, we then disaggregated (downscaled) these larger cells back down to 1 km grid (using the \texttt{raster} package's \texttt{disaggregate()} function), but assigning the smaller cells the same value as the coarser input raster's cell values, rather than interpolating values.

\hypertarget{processing-spatial-data-and-producing-biodiversity-indices}{%
\subsubsection{Processing spatial data and producing biodiversity indices}\label{processing-spatial-data-and-producing-biodiversity-indices}}

In total, we produced 90 unique indices to cover the full range of permutations in the groups above. This included three existing published biodiversity composite indices (n = 3), three richness metrics for four taxonomic groups as well as for all vertebrates groups combined (n = 3 x 5 = 15, including vertebrate endemism richness, which we compare to the existing composite indices), four methods for three pairs of layers (n = 4 x 3 = 12), yielding 30 distinct combinations. Each of these 30 layers was calculated at three resolutions (1 km grid, 10 km grid, and 110 km grid), yielding 90 unique model runs.

Species range maps were filtered prior to the calculation of species richness in order to: exclude marine species; exclude species classified as ``Extinct'' (EX) or ``Extinct in the Wild'' (EW); include only ranges where species were considered ``extant;'' include only ranges where species are considered ``native'' or ``reintroduced;'' and include only portions of the range where species are ``resident,'' ``breeding,'' or ``non-breeding'' (i.e.~wintering, excluding ``passage'' areas for migratory species).

Species range maps, richness maps, biodiversity indices, and the resulting model outputs were processed in RStudio version 1.4.993, using R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22), using the \texttt{agroEcoTradeoff}, \texttt{data.table}, \texttt{sf}, \texttt{raster}, \texttt{dtraster}, \texttt{fasterize}, \texttt{tidyverse}, \texttt{lmisc}, \texttt{rgdal}, \texttt{sp}, \texttt{gdalUtils}, \texttt{rasterVis}, \texttt{tictoc}, \texttt{lwgeom}, \texttt{magrittr}, \texttt{reshape2}, \texttt{cowplot}, \texttt{knitr}, \texttt{spatstat}, \texttt{rmarkdown}, \texttt{bookdown}, \texttt{pryr}, and \texttt{viridis} packages.

Before running the \texttt{agroEcoTradeoff} model, each biodiversity index was cropped and masked to the outline of Zambia, removing large bodies of water, then rescaled to between 0-1, setting a given index's maximum value to 1 and the minimum to 0. This involved taking the value of each cell, subtracting the index's global minimum value, then dividing this value by the difference between the global maximum and the global minimum.

\hypertarget{calculation-of-weighted-jaccard-similarity-index}{%
\subsection{Calculation of weighted Jaccard Similarity index}\label{calculation-of-weighted-jaccard-similarity-index}}

As a measure of spatial consistency across model results, we calculated a weighted version of the Jaccard Similarity index (Ioffe 2010; Legendre and Legendre 2012) for all pairs of factors within each category of variation. The Jaccard Similarity is a pairwise similarity metric commonly used to assess similarity between two sets, and is defined as the proportion of elements in either set that are shared between the two, or the intersection of the two sets divided by the union of the two sets: \(J(a,b) = \frac{a\cap b}{a\cup b}\) (Legendre and Legendre 2012). In the context of the categorical conversion maps produced by the \texttt{agroEcoTradeoff} model, the Jaccard Similarity between two model runs is simply the number of cells selected for conversion in both model runs \(a\) and \(b\) divided by the number of cells selected for conversion by either model runs \(a\) or \(b\). However, our ensemble averages have values that fall continuously between 0-1 and are no longer categorical in nature, instead representing the proportion of model runs that select that particular pixel for conversion. To account for this variation, we instead calculated an adapted weighted Jaccard Similarity Index (Ioffe 2010), defined in Equation \eqref{eq:jac-w}.

\begin{equation}
J_{w} (a,b) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n min(a_{i}, b_{i})}{\sum_{i=1}^n max(a_{i}, b_{i})} \label{eq:jac-w}
\end{equation}

The weighted Jaccard Similarity (\(J_w\)) allows us to compare non-categorical rasters and can be interpreted as a measure of congruence (how well two factors agree about the least costly areas to convert to agriculture). The lower the similarity value for a particular factor, the less similar it is to the other factors within a given category of variation. Low similarity values across an entire category of variation indicates that the choice represented by that category of variation (e.g.~which taxonomic group to use) has a large effect on the model recommendations.

The weighted Jaccard Similarity is a pairwise metric, so calculating the mean Jaccard Similarity for a given factor's ensemble mean required averaging across all possible pairs with that particular ensemble mean within each category of variation. We only calculate pairwise Jaccard Similarity between ensemble means within each category of variation to allow for consistent comparisons. For example, the mean \(J_w\) for mammals is the mean of three pairwise similarity values between mammals and the other three taxonomic groups: \(J_w(mammals, birds)\), \(J_w(mammals,amphibians)\), and \(J_w(mammals,reptiles)\). This metric gives us a sense of how similar the model's conversion recommendations are across the different taxonomic groups (and similarly across the factors of variation in the other categories of variation). A \(J_w\) = 0.70 means that two sets are 70\% similar to each other, or have an overlap of 70\%. The lower the mean \(J_w\) value of a particular ensemble mean (i.e.~mammals, threatened species richness, 110 km grid resolution, etc.), the less similar it is to the other factors within a category of variation. Low values across an entire category of variation indicates that variation within that category of variation has a relatively larger effect on the model outcomes than that within other categories of variation.

Figure \ref{fig:pairwise-jaccard} shows the pairwise Jaccard Similarity values for our primary analysis (\emph{bp}). While these values are included in Fig. 3, this additional figure shows each pairwise value more clearly.

\hypertarget{challenges-with-spatial-uncertainty-analysis}{%
\subsection{Challenges with spatial uncertainty analysis}\label{challenges-with-spatial-uncertainty-analysis}}

Our study also highlights the challenges of conducting spatial uncertainty and sensitivity analyses (Lilburne and Tarantola 2009), which are rarely factored into conservation planning (though see Field and Elphick (2019)). With such large scales and so many units of analysis (pixels), formal uncertainty analyses such as systematic Monte Carlo methods become computationally prohibitive, making it difficult to choose between multiple options for constructing biodiversity indices. We ultimately chose a simple similarity metric that allows for systematic comparison across many pairs of layers, complemented with a spatial measure of adjacency (see Section \ref{section-adjacency}). Our ensemble means allow us to isolate variation due to a give choice, while allowing for variation in other ways.

We also avoid any prediction of ``biodiversity loss'' resulting from various configurations of conversion, because such a calculation requires many of the same choices that we seek to explore here, making it difficult to determine an unbiased metric. However, given the complex nature of these comparisons, it is inevitable that the use of our similarity metric simplified trends and differences between layers, and we recognize these limitations. Though coarser than a formal uncertainty analysis, this analysis nevertheless represents a valuable step towards understanding the implications of the wide variation in how we choose to represent biodiversity.

\hypertarget{robust}{%
\section{Additional Analyses \& Results}\label{robust}}

\hypertarget{section-adjacency}{%
\subsection{Adjacency: nearest neighbor distance}\label{section-adjacency}}

As an additional measure of spatial similarity, we calculate \emph{adjacency}, as the average nearest neighbor distance for each factor ensemble mean (Figure \ref{fig:nnd-fig}). This represents the average distance between each pixel in ensemble mean \(a\) and its nearest neighbor in ensemble mean \(b\). Because these factor ensemble means are continuous between 0-1, not categorical, calculating adjacency required adjusting the distance based on the value of the cell in \(a\) and the value of its nearest nearest neighbor in \(b\), by multiplying the distance by the average of those two values. We then took a weighted average of these adjusted distances, dividing by the sum of the averaged cell values (instead of the number of points). These results generally agree with what we see in Fig. 3. Different richness metrics and taxonomic groups have a much higher average distance to their nearest neighbor, meaning that the individual factors within richness metrics and taxonomic groups produce model recommendations are physically farther from each other than factors in other decision categories. This matches with Fig. 3, which shows that types and taxonomic groups are much less similar than methods and resolution. In contrast, methods and resolution show much lower distances, meaning that different factors are more similar to each other (matching Fig. 3), but also, that when model recommendations do not match, they remain relatively close spatially within the country.

\newpage

\hypertarget{section-threat}{%
\subsection{Threatened species richness}\label{section-threat}}

We did not include threatened species richness in our main analysis of different richness metrics because reptiles have not been comprehensively assessed by IUCN, making it impossible to calculate the number of threatened reptile species (and therefore, the number of threatened vertebrate species) in Zambia. For context, only 37 out of the 226 reptile species included in the GARD database (Roll et al. 2017) that occur in Zambia have been assessed by the IUCN. Of those, only three are listed as threatened: \emph{Malacochersus tornieri} (pancake tortoise), \emph{Cycloderma frenatum} (Zambezi flapshell turtle), and \emph{Mecistops cataphractus} (slender-snouted crocodile) (see Table \ref{tab:species-occurrence}).

Based on our framework of analysis, in which multiple model runs are averaged into ensemble means that isolate the variation due to each factor (i.e.~each richness metric), any comparison of threatened species richness would therefore require us to leave out reptile species, not only from our calculation of threatened species richness, but also the other three richness metrics in order to keep the comparisons consistent.

We display these results in Figure \ref{fig:threat-richness}, for mammals, birds, and amphibians, along with all species richness, endemism richness, threatened species richness, and small-ranged species richness. Note that these model runs assumed 100\% weight on biodiversity, the baseline production target, and average yields throughout Zambia (following our primary \emph{bp} model specification).

We found a category mean \(J_w\) = 0.10 for the three taxonomic groups (mammals, birds, and amphibians), and category mean \(J_w\) = 0.17 for the four richness metrics (all, endemism, threatened, and small-ranged). These results are remarkably similar to our primary analysis, though the addition of threatened species richness reduces the overall similarity between richness metrics (our original \emph{bp} analysis, which excluded threatened species richness but included reptiles, produced category mean \(J_w\) = 0.10 and 0.26 for taxa and richness metrics, respectively). If anything, this strengthens the overall conclusions of this study.

\newpage

\hypertarget{section-prod-targ}{%
\subsection{Increasing the production target}\label{section-prod-targ}}

Our first robustness check involved assessing the influence of our production target on the similarity results, by increasing the production target from the baseline level of \textasciitilde5\% all the way to \textasciitilde50\% (while retaining 100\% of the model weight on biodiversity, and assuming mean yields). Our original model run (\emph{bp}), assumes a production target of \textasciitilde5\% based on current projections of demand and yield growth (L. D. Estes et al. 2016), amounting to about 22,000 km\(^2\) of land (about the size of New Jersey). For comparison we run the model with a much higher production target, at \textasciitilde50\% (\emph{z50}), in order to assess how similarity is affected by the size of the area being converted (and therefore, being compared).

The relative similarity between these two production targets is shown in Figure 4 of the main text, and reproduced here as Figure \ref{fig:z50-bp-comparison}. We find that running the model with this larger production target produces higher overall similarity: for example, mean \(J_w\) = 0.36 across all existing indices (Figure \ref{fig:z50-bp-comparison}, in light green), compared to mean \(J_w\) = 0.0223 for our primary analysis (\emph{bp}, in dark purple). We expect higher similarity when a greater proportion of the country is converted, simply because there is less area left for disagreement. The pattern of relative differences between categories of variation stays the same, showing which sources of variation have the largest effect on land-use outcomes. Most importantly, we find low levels of agreement at this high production target scenario, even with such high production targets. For visual comparison of ensemble mean conversion areas for this \emph{z50} weighting specification, see Figure \ref{fig:facet-r-z50}.

\newpage

\hypertarget{section-norm-order}{%
\subsection{Normalization order}\label{section-norm-order}}

Additional purely methodological choices that can influence the final biodiversity index include the simple decision to change the order in which taxonomic groups are normalized and combined into a single layer, whether treating all species equally or each taxonomic group equally, which can result in model results that are only 79\% similar (see Figure \ref{fig:norm-order}).

We compared the influence of the stage at which normalization takes place, by comparing these two common ways of calculating the cumulative vertebrate richness: 1) by normalizing within each taxa first before summing across taxa (effectively averaging the four taxonomic groups, following Brancalion et al. (2019), or 2) by summing across all four taxa, without normalizing first following Laurance et al. (2014). Our main analysis follows the first method (i.e.~normalizing before summing across taxa).

On the one hand, summing first treats all species as equally valuable. But, it ends up being biased towards some taxa. Using threatened species as an example, birds (max threatened species richness 15 species, 20 total species occurring anywhere in Zambia) and mammals (max threatened species richness 7 species, 11 total species occurring anywhere in Zambia) are overrepresented, compared to amphibians and reptiles, which each have a maximum threatened species richness of just 1 in Zambia (amphibians have one threatened species occurring in Zambia, and reptiles have 3). If normalization takes place within each taxa before being summed across taxa, it will give that one threatened amphibian species the same weight as 15 threatened bird species.

We found that the ensemble mean conversion map produced from the three vertebrate species richness metrics at our three resolutions (n = 9) when using this normalization order had a pairwise weighted Jaccard Similarity \(J_w\) of 0.789 (see Figure \ref{fig:norm-order}) with the ensemble mean calculated from the opposite normalization order. In other words, the simple decision to count each species as equal instead of counting each taxonomic group as equal results in model results that are only 78.9\% similar. This is less consequential than the choices in the categories of variation we assess in our main text (e.g.~category means for existing indices: 2.2\%; taxonomic groups: 10.3\%; richness metrics: 26\%; combination methods: 59.4\%; and spatial resolutions: 59.2\%), but it is striking how much of a difference it can make.

Positive values show areas selected only by the ``norm\_first'' method, and negative values show areas selected by only the ``sum\_first'' method. Areas with a value of 0 are areas where the two approaches agree (either to convert or not to convert).}\label{fig:norm-order}
\end{figure}

\newpage

\hypertarget{section-order}{%
\subsection{Directly comparing the order of conversion}\label{section-order}}

We also directly compared the similarity of the order in which cells are prioritized for conversion based on biodiversity value (entirely removing the effect of the production target). In these scenarios, each pixel in Zambia is given a value corresponding to the order in which that pixel would be converted or protected. Figure \ref{fig:order-conv} and Figure \ref{fig:order-protect} show the similarity of the order in which cells are prioritized for conversion or protection respectively, for each ensemble mean. Cells are prioritized for conversion in order from lowest biodiversity to highest, and prioritized for protection from highest to lowest biodiversity (the inverse of conversion). The pattern of similarity between these two analyses is nearly identical. The results show higher similarity than our base case (\emph{bp}), which is again expected given that each cell in Zambia is given a value, and there is less area for disagreement. Because of the way the weighted Jaccard Similarity index is calculated, incorporating individual cell values (minimum and maximum) and not just the spatial overlap, selecting cells based on conversion order rather than protection order could in theory produce differences. However, these two selection orders show strikingly similar results, with the same pattern of relative differences across categories of variation.

In addition to the four existing indices we compare in our main analysis, we also considered two specific subsets of the Laurance et al. (2014) composite, as well as a hypothetical composite oriented towards bird conservation.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{plants}: Total plant species richness per ecoregion, weighted by ecoregion area (Kier et al. 2005)
\item
  \emph{habitats}: A habitat prioritization index derived from four well-known habitat prioritizations, each equally weighted. This is included as one sub component of the Laurance et al. (2014) index, but we felt it important to consider an index that represents expert-prioritized habitats separately, to better understand their effect on prioritization.

\item
  BirdLife International's Important Bird Areas (IBAs) and Endemic Bird Areas (EBAs) (Stattersfield et al. 1998; Butchart et al. 2012; Waliczky et al. 2019)
\item
  High Biodiversity Wilderness Areas (Mittermeier et al. 2003) (note that there are no Frontier Forests in Zambia)

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

These \emph{plants}, \emph{habitats}, and \emph{bird\_composite} indices were not included in our main analysis, in order to keep our analysis consistent (the \emph{plants} and \emph{habitats} layers, by virtue of being part of the \emph{laurance} composite, show relatively higher similarity to each other). However, for the sake of comparison, we show the ensemble mean conversion maps for the full set of seven indices and their mean Jaccard Similarities (\(J_w\)) in Figure \ref{fig:all-composites}.

\hypertarget{weights-results}{%
\subsection{Incorporating non-biodiversity constraints}\label{weights-results}}

In addition to our baseline scenario (\emph{bp}, with 100\% on biodiversity, assuming homogeneous yields throughout Zambia), we ran the model through five additional scenarios that progressively shared weight between biodiversity and yield, carbon loss, and transportation cost, allowing these factors to also influence conversion decisions. As previously described in Section \ref{model-weights}, these model scenarios are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{b} = 100\% biodiversity, accurate, spatially heterogeneous yields
\item
  \emph{by} = 50\%/50\% biodiversity/yield
\item
  \emph{bc} = 50\%/50\% biodiversity/carbon
\item
  \emph{bt} = 50\%/50\% biodiversity/transportation cost, and
\item
  \emph{byct} = 25\% weight on biodiversity, yield, carbon, and transportation cost
\end{itemize}

First, we show the mean Jaccard Similarity for each model specification, together in Figure \ref{fig:jac-w-weights-line}. This shows that as weight is increasingly placed on non-biodiversity constraints, similarity increases overall, yet the pattern of relative similarity between categories of variation remains the same.















\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{5_SI_files/figure-latex/jac-w-weights-line-1} \caption{Mean Jaccard Similarity between ensemble means within different categories of variation, as shown across different model weighting schemes. All weighting specifications assume accurate, spatially heterogeneous yields except for \emph{bp} and \emph{z50}. \emph{bp} = 100\% biodiversity, average yields, \emph{b} = 100\% biodiversity, accurate, spatially heterogeneous yields, \emph{by} = 50\%/50\% biodiversity/yield, \emph{bc} = 50\%/50\% biodiversity/carbon, \emph{bt} = 50\%/50\% biodiversity/transportation cost, \emph{byct} = 25\% weight on biodiversity, yield, carbon, and transportation cost, and \emph{z50} = production target converting 50\% of Zambia.}\label{fig:jac-w-weights-line}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:jac-w-all} shows similarity between ensemble means that incorporate model runs at each weighting specification. Just like the construction of ensemble means in our main scenario include runs at three resolutions for a given factor, these ensemble means also include runs across the six weighting specifications at the baseline production target. This effectively removes the influence of weighting specification, by looking at patterns across all weighting specifications.

Importantly, Figure \ref{fig:jac-w-all} also shows similarity between ensemble means for each model weighting specification itself (\emph{weights}). These ensemble means average across \textbf{all} model runs for each weighting specification, in order to isolate the variation due to model weighting specifically. While we are not surprised to see differences in model recommendations when we value biodiversity less and incorporate other environmental and economic concerns, we \textbf{are} surprised to see the magnitude of the differences caused by changing these weights compared to the magnitude of differences caused by factors in the other categories of variation. Similarity levels across weighting specifications are at about the same level as similarity between different existing indices and different taxonomic groups. This means that changing model weights has an effect that is similar in magnitude to that cause by using a different existing index or using a different taxonomic group, regardless of the weighting specification. In other words, different existing indices and taxonomic groups differ from each other as much as entirely different value judgments about how to weight biodiversity relative to other environmental and economic concerns. Variation in these non-biodiversity costs is a good area for future exploration.

The relative changes in similarity across the different weighting schemes are shown in Figure \ref{fig:jac-w-weights-line}. Diving into the results for each individual weighting specification, we test the influence of including accurate and spatially heterogenous yields in the calculation of biodiversity in terms of production efficiency, while placing 100\% of model weight on biodiversity (\emph{b}, Figure \ref{fig:jac-w-b}), then equally weighting biodiversity and yield (\emph{by}, Figure \ref{fig:jac-w-by}) in the model weighting specification. Figures \ref{fig:jac-w-bc} and \ref{fig:jac-w-bt} shows similarity results when equally weighting biodiversity and either carbon loss (\emph{bc}) or transportation cost (\emph{bt}). Figure \ref{fig:jac-w-byct} shows similarity when placing equal weight on all four constraints (\emph{byct}).

\end{figure}

In the real world, decision makers must consider factors other than biodiversity when making land-use decisions. When distributing weight from biodiversity to yield, carbon storage, and transportation costs, we found that the similarity between land-use recommendations increased overall, though the overall pattern of relative differences between factors in the different categories remained largely consistent. This is not so surprising, considering that we held these other three costs constant, so including them in our model reduced the amount of variation between model runs. However, we also found that different model weighting specifications produced recommendations that differed from each other by about the same amount as different existing indices and taxonomic groups (see Figure \ref{fig:jac-w-all}). This signals a relative lack of congruence between the four constraints themselves: the least-cost areas for biodiversity do not necessarily overlap with those that maximize yields, minimize transportation cost, or minimize carbon emissions.

This supports research that has shown that goals related to climate mitigation and adaptation and those related to biodiversity conservation are not always spatially aligned (Anderson et al. 2009; Thomas et al. 2013), and that variation in socioeconomic factors can have greater importance for determining land-use priorities than biodiversity (Field and Elphick 2019; Keeler et al. 2019). That such tradeoffs between social and environmental goals exist means that when factoring many constraints into a land-use prioritization model, variation in biodiversity may be dominated by variation between broad constraints. Of course, biodiversity is not the only aspect of land use prioritization that is subject to uncertainty. We held these other three factors constant, but they are surely subject to uncertainty and variation worthy of exploration, even though estimates of yields, carbon storage, and travel cost are not dependent on values judgments in the way that maps of biodiversity value are.
